import Button from "../components/Button";

# You did it!

You've found the next Slide!

To add a new slide, add `myslide.mdx` to `src/slides` and then add `myslide` to `order` in `config.js`.
Your typography will be formatted by [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin).

Because this is MDX, you can also add react components, like this Button:

<Button
  onClick={() => {
    console.log("clickck");
    alert("you clicked me!!!");
  }}
>
  Click me
</Button>
